    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, often known as "murgh makhani," is one of the many curry-based Indian cuisines available. While it is frequently served all over the world, there are slight differences in flavor and preparation methods depending on the country in which you consume it.<br><br>This delightful dish is produced by marinating small pieces of chicken in a fragrant mixture of ginger, garlic, and a variety of curry spices, then simmering them in a rich, creamy tomato and butter-based sauce.</p>
